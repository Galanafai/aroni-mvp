# Aroni MVP

**Aroni** is a scan integrity and traceability platform that combines frontend QR metadata generation, backend scan validation, and cryptographic anchoring to provide supply chain transparency and operational confidence. This document is a complete, detailed explanation of the logic, architecture, and functionality across the Aroni MVP project.

---

## 🧠 Purpose & Core Concept

Aroni is designed to:

* Digitally fingerprint physical packages using QR codes
* Log every interaction (scan) with those packages
* Detect mismatches in real-world vs. expected metadata
* Anchor those scan logs into a tamper-proof, trustable record using Merkle Trees and (optionally) blockchain

It enables real-time verification and auditability of goods moving across a supply chain.

## 🚦 Full System Flow

### 1. **Metadata Submission (Frontend)**

* User fills out metadata for a package:

  * SKU, quantity, weight, dimensions, source/destination, urgency, etc.
* `tracking_id` is auto-generated using `uuidv4()`
* A timestamp is also attached.
* A QR code is generated using only the `tracking_id` or hashed metadata.
* The full metadata payload is POSTed to `POST /api/metadata`

### 2. **QR Label Is Printed**

* The generated QR is displayed for the user.
* It contains `{ tracking_id: <uuid> }`
* It is printed and physically attached to the package.

### 3. **Scan Verification (Frontend)**

* A human or CV system scans the QR, which returns a `tracking_id`
* User inputs actual measured values: weight, quantity, dimensions
* These are POSTed to `POST /api/scan`

### 4. **Scan Validation (Backend)**

* The backend fetches metadata from Supabase using the `tracking_id`
* Compares real scan data to metadata:

  * Tolerances may be applied
  * Records a `match` or `mismatch`
* Hashes the full scan payload
* Appends the hash to scan log

### 5. **Merkle Tree Anchoring (Optional)**

* Periodically or manually, a batch of scan logs is used to build a Merkle Tree
* The root hash can be published on-chain
* Proofs can be generated for each scan

---

## 🔐 Backend Modules

### `scan.go`

* Handles `POST /api/scan`
* Validates, hashes, and stores scan logs

### `scan_logs.go`

* Handles `GET /api/scans`
* Returns a list of all scan logs
* Used for the dashboard

### `metadata.go`

* Handles `POST /api/metadata`
* Inserts original package metadata into Supabase

### `proof_endpoint.go`

* Handles anchoring logic and Merkle root serving

### `supabase_client.go`

* All communication with Supabase REST API
* Uses `http.NewRequestWithContext`
* Fetches metadata, inserts logs, retrieves logs

### `merkle.go`

* Merkle tree construction from scan hashes
* Tree building rules:

  * Pad odd leaves
  * SHA256(left + right)
  * Return root + proof path

---

## 💻 Frontend Pages

### `Home.tsx`

* Top-level navigation to all major routes

### `MetadataForm.tsx`

* Lets user input metadata
* Auto-generates UUID + timestamp
* Displays a dynamic QR code
* Submits metadata to backend

### `ScanSubmission.tsx`

* User scans a package
* Enters observed values
* Submits to backend

### `Dashboard.tsx`

* Fetches all scans via `/api/scans`
* Shows:

  * match/mismatch result
  * anchor status (✔️ if `scan_hash` exists)
  * scan timestamp
  * quantity, dimensions, notes
  * tracking ID opens drawer for full detail
* Includes filtering: `match`, `mismatch`, `all`

---

## 📦 QR Code Structure

* At metadata submission:

```json
{ "tracking_id": "uuid-v4" }
```

* This ensures CV scanners can simply decode QR → use ID → fetch from backend
* You can optionally add a Merkle hash to the QR in the future:

```json
{ "tracking_id": "uuid", "hash": "sha256sum" }
```
